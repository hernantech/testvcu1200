This file is just a way to visually track the dependencies of the bms1000m class.
So we can at least somewhat identify what classes need to be re-written (contains code that is TI specific)

For files that have not been checked yet, their respective dependency tree will be marked as [UNCHECKED]

bms1000m
    -critical = maybe needs to be changed?
        -interrupt = needs changes
    -can_interface
        -hw_ints = needs changes
        -hw_memmap = needs changes
        -can = [UNCHECKED]
        -gpio = [UNCHECKED]
        -interrupt = [UNCHECKED]
        -sysctl = [UNCHECKED]
    -can_receiver = [UNCHECKED]
    -error = [UNCHECKED]

Here is a list of all classes identified that are required to be modified:

1) driverlib/interrupt
2) inc/hw_ints
3) inc/hw_memmap

Please open issues for these classes in the issues tab
